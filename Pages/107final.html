  <h3>This work simply reflects the mood of a person with mild depression. Depressed people often feel like they are submerged in the sea, constantly sinking to the bottom of the sea. The hand stretches out shows that the depressed want to ask for help, but in the end, they can not withstand the wave of pressure and can only be submerged in the sea. The darkness around shows that the depressed can't find the direction of confusion.</h3>

<h3>According to documentary interviews with depressed people, depression patients often fantasize about their own death and funeral. Even if their physical bodies are in the noisy street, they still imagine that they are in a silent and empty dark environment, and the empty coffin is waiting for them. This project represents the mental world of a depressed person who is often alive but doesn't know the meaning of being alive. Depression, like the illusion of a funeral, trapped them. They tried to call for help, they tried to escape, but there was no direction...</h3>

<h3>We often find it difficult to find the side of the hidden depression patients, more often we think they are fatigue and pressure is too big. However, when we realize the seriousness of the matter and want to reach out to help the patient, the patient's situation is very serious. In fact, compared with being anxious to pull patients out of the "vortex", we should do is to accompany them, and give patience. Let the drowning depression find the escape rope slowly.
