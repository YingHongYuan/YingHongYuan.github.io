<h1>DROWNING</h1>
  <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
</div>

<p>During this semester, all three of my projects focus on the perspective of people with depression. My project audience is all the depression patients around me. Because depression is often hard to detect, or ignored. Many people think that depression is just thinking too much and stress is too much. In fact, it comes from many factors. The cause of depression is not single, but multifaceted. But the relatives and friends around do not understand and ignore will bring greater pressure to patients with depression. I hope that through this project, people can pay more attention to patients with depression. I chose this topic because I was in a state of mild depression. I also found that my friends have many similar experiences. So I think depression is an easy state to enter. When we enter this state, our vision and thinking will become extremely negative. So we can resonate with the patients around us.</p>

<p>In project #1 "falling", I created a digital three-dimensional environment to describe the psychological activities of patients with depression. Project #1 simply reflects the mood of a person with mild depression. Depressed people often feel like they are submerged in the sea, constantly sinking to the bottom of the sea. The hand stretches out shows that the depressed want to ask for help, but in the end, they can not withstand the wave of pressure and can only be submerged in the sea. The darkness around shows that the depressed can't find the direction of confusion.</p>

<p>In Project #2, based on the project one,  I extended more points about the environment, feelings and emotions of depression. Based on the inner world of the depressed, I extend the environmental materials and factors that can be used, such as funerals and fog.  Project 2 will enhance the concept of project 1, which aims to make the audience feel the inner world of depression more directly when watching the work. According to documentary interviews with depressed people, depression patients often fantasize about their own death and funeral. Even if their physical bodies are in the noisy street, they still imagine that they are in a silent and empty dark environment, and the empty coffin is waiting for them. This project represents the mental world of a depressed person who is often alive but doesn't know the meaning of being alive. Depression, like the illusion of a funeral, trapped them. They tried to call for help, they tried to escape, but there was no direction...</p>

<p>In project #3, I made an animated video trying to illustrate the relationship between bystanders and patients with depression.We often find it difficult to find the side of the hidden depression patients, more often we think they are fatigue and pressure is too big. However, when we realize the seriousness of the matter and want to reach out to help the patient, the patient's situation is very serious. In fact, compared with being anxious to pull patients out of the "vortex", we should accompany them, and give patience. Let the drowning depression find the escape rope slowly.</p>
