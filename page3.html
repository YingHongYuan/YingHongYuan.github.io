    <h2> Installation Video, 2019</h2>
    <h3>For creating an installation video I am going to focus on drunk driving, with looking two videos on the same lap, my goal is to present the visual and state of a driver after drinking. With the increase in the number of drinks and the increase in body alcohol concentration, the driver's body changes are shown in his visual judgment of road conditions.
