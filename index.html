    <p style="font-family:times;font-size:120%"> My name is YingHong Yuan. A Ungraduated student who majoring Digital Media Art in SJSU. My artworks inspired by my reflection on some social problems and the expression of personal feelings. At this stage, most of my works are digital images made by Illustrator and Photoshop and were finished by following the course requirements of the college. I also expanded more areas of digital media art, such as video art and installation art. I consider the social problem and put my thought into the artworks represents to the audience by the visual effect. I think that digital media art is extremely important that not only is shown on the television advertisement but also billboards everywhere on the street which are an important medium of display. One time, I saw an electronic advertisement screen specially designed for children's domestic violence help-seeking information. This electronic advertisement screen, at the height of adults, was an ordinary portrait of children, but at the height of children and it was an abused and scared child with some help-seeking methods. Inspired by that, my goal is to use digital media art to convey something that influences and help society.
